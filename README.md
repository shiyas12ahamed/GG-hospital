# GG-hospital
Website of GG hospital.
There are 2 files,
Topheader and navbar.
The navbar file has the first section of the webpage with the navigation bar.
All the commits after the navbar portions have been made in the topheader file.
topheader.html is the final file with all the code for the project.
All the commits after the navbar creation have been made in the dev-branch of the repository. 
Hence the final code lies in the topheader file of the dev branch.
